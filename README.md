# PostgreSQL Lab Sessions

A full set of hands-on PostgreSQL exercises captured directly from the `psql` terminal.
Each lab demonstrates practical database management, query design, transactions, and backup workflows using real console sessions.

# Final Project

## Topic: MMO RPG

A relational database for an MMO-style role-playing game world, implemented in PostgreSQL.  
The final project includes:

- Full database schema for regions, settlements, players, guilds, items, dungeons, enemies, quests, and more
- Basic and advanced SQL queries
- Transaction examples on realistic gameplay scenarios
- Indexing strategy
- Backup and recovery strategy using `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`
- Full database ER-diagram
-

## Overview

This repository tracks my full journey through a university database systems course — from basic table operations to ACID transactions and WAL backups.
Every file is a **live transcript**, not rewritten SQL. Commands, warnings, and even errors are part of the learning process.

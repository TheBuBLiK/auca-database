# PostgreSQL Lab Sessions

A full set of hands-on PostgreSQL exercises captured directly from the `psql` terminal.
Each lab demonstrates practical database management, query design, transactions, and backup workflows using real console sessions.

## Overview

This repository tracks my full journey through a university database systems course — from basic table operations to ACID transactions and WAL backups.
Every file is a **live transcript**, not rewritten SQL. Commands, warnings, and even errors are part of the learning process.
